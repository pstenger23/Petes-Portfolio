                    <h2>Personal Life</h2>

                    <p>As you already know, my name is Peter Stenger, I am a 23 years old and identify with He/Him/His pronouns. 
                        I am a web-developer originally from the suburbs of Chicago, IL,  
                        however  currently reside in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. My interests are cycling, spending time with family, 
                        and designing beautiful websites for all to access and enjoy.
                    </p>

                        <h2>Professional Life</h2>
                    
                        <p>I believe that the success of any venture can be attributed to their accessibility and originality of 
                            their web presence. Through sleek designs and smooth functioning websites people get a sense of satisfaction 
                            from interacting with them. I aspire to continue to grow my knowledge of full stack web development as it 
                            is rapidly changing, and within the next five years would like to see myself in a leadership role amongst a
                            strong web development team.
