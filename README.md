# Peter Stenger's Portfolio

## **Welcome** to my portfolio!

This website has been built to showcase some of my best developments and projects.
I currently have displayed my first projects created through the University of Wisconsin's 
Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. Here you will find; Landing pages for both Run-Buddy and Horiseon, as well as my very first project in Javascript: Robot Gladiator's!.

## **Purpose**

This site has been build and deployed for the purpose of showing potential new employers my previous work history, 
as well as my overal skills in web development and a section about who I am as a person and a web developer.
